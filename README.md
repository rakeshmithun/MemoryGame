# MemoryGame
 RMIT project 2 - Memory game

## Quickstart
- Download the project and decompress into a directory
- Locate `index.html` and open it with your favourite internet browser

**Game function:**
 - The game has 8 cards that needs to be matched against their identical tile bringing the total number of cards to 16 before a congratulations modal will pop-up announcing that you have won the game.
 - The timer function starts as soon as the 2nd tile has been shown.
 - You can restart the game any time by clicking on the restart icon above the main deck at any time during the game.
 - The star rating is decremented after the user has made 8 moves.

**Dependencies:**
- I have referenced external CSS files and also mentioned the gitHub repo example where I borrowed and given credit to the animations and media queries.

**Future implementation/Nice to have**
- I would like to move the star rating into a dynamic HTML string like the cards solution before using innerHTML remove them based on rating or even give them more than 3 stars
