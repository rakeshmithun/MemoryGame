# MemoryGame
 RMIT project 2 - Memory game

**Game function:**
 - The game has 8 cards that needs to be matched against their identical tile bringing the total number of cards to 16 before a congratulations modal will pop-up announcing that you have won the game.
 - The timer function starts as soon as the 2nd tile has been flipped.
 - You can restart the game any time by clicking on the restart icon above the main deck.

**Dependencies:**
- I have referenced external CSS files and also mentioned the gitHub repo example where I borrowed and given credit to the animations and media queries.
